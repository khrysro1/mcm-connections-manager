# Introduction
#
# The Monocaffe Connection Manager is created to ease the management of connections to different
# servers a sysadmin usuarlly connect to. I'm aiming to provide support for:
# -ssh
# -telnet
# -vnc
# -rdesktop
# -ICA (Citrix) TO DO
#
# This basically depends on which of this programs can be called from the command line without
# too much trouble. Also, very basic options will be used, so if you want more complex options
# like mount usb drives for rdesktop, or sound for VNC, use the proper utilities for this or
# modify mcm.
#
# Configuration
# mcm comes configured for Ubuntu (my platform) but basically, all you need to modify in case one
# of the commands isn't found, is the file connections.py. There you'll find the global tuples where
# the paths to the clients are specified. You can change them freely.
#
# Also, if you preffer to change any of them to be the first, do so modifying the tuples mentioned
# before.
